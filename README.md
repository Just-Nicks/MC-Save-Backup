A lightweight Python utility that automatically backs up your Minecraft worlds from different launchers and mod loaders.

The script copies all saves from the selected launcher and stores them in a dedicated backup folder inside your Documents directory.

```text
%AppData%/.minecraft/saves
```

```text
C:/Users/<username>/curseforge/minecraft/Instances/<instance>/saves
```

* Python 3.8+
* Rich

Install all required packages using the provided requirements.txt file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install rich

## 🤔 How to use

Run the script:

```bash
python main.py
```

### ❗❗OR RUN THE EXECUTABLE❗❗

You will be asked to choose your launcher:

```text
1 Minecraft Launcher
2 CurseForge
3 Modrinth
```

For CurseForge and Modrinth, enter the exact instance/profile name when prompted.

The script will:

1. Verify the selected instance exists.
2. Check if save files are available.
3. Ask before overwriting an existing backup.
4. Copy all worlds to the backup directory.
5. Display a progress bar while copying.

## Example

```text
Select your launcher: 2
Enter the instance name: Better MC
```

The worlds from:

```text
curseforge/minecraft/Instances/Better MC/saves
```

will be copied to:

```text
Documents/Saves Backups MC/curseforge/Better MC
```

## ❓ Why I Built This

I frequently play on multiple Minecraft launchers and modpacks. Manually locating and backing up worlds every time became tedious, especially before updating mods or testing new versions.

This tool provides a quick way to create backups before making changes that could potentially corrupt a world.
